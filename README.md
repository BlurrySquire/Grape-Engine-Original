# Grape Engine
A 2D Game Engine created with C++ and Vulkan.

## Attributions
- Thank you to [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) for the ``defines.hpp`` file. It was designed for use with C and [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), I modified it to better suit my engine and C++. If you would like a list of the modifications made they are in the top comment of ``engine/source/defines.hpp``. I also took the platform layer design from [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) by [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) and modified it for use with my game engine.

## To-Do
- [ ] Start work on windowing/creating a rendering canavs in the platform layer.
- [ ] Start documenting the API.
