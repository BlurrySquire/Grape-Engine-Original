  Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/travisvroman">Travis Vroman</a> for the <strong>'engine/source/defines.hpp'</strong> file. It was design for use with C and <a href="https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi">Kohi</a>, I modified it to better suit my engine and C++. A list of the modifications are in a comment at the top of the file.
