# Grape-Engine
A W.I.P 2D Game engine created in C, and uses Vulkan for rendering.

## The Plan
I have many features planned:
- An optional editor for creating your games. Integration with C (possibly C++ in the future?).
- Modular runtime for the engine (your project only includes the parts of the engine that it uses).
