# Grape Engine
A 2D Game Engine created with C++ and Vulkan.

## Attributions
- Thank you to [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) for the ``defines.hpp`` file. It was designed for use with C and [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), I modified it to better suit my engine and C++. If you would like a list of the modifications made they are in the top comment of ``engine/source/defines.hpp``. I also took the platform layer design from [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) by [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) and modified it for use with my game engine.

## To-Do
My game engine is a bit of a mess. I am revamping everything before continuing development. The items in the list are in order of importance.
- [X] Revamp the logger.
- [X] Revamp the platform layer.
- [ ] Switch over to Premake for the build system.
- [ ] Windows platform layer. (W.I.P)
- [ ] Linux platform layer.
- [ ] Create an application layer.
- [ ] Work on LUA integration using [Sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2).
