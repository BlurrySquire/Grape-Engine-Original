# Grape Engine
A 2D Game Engine created with C++ and Vulkan.

## Attributions
- Thank you to [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) for the ``defines.hpp`` file. It was designed for use with C and [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), I modified it to better suit my engine and C++. If you would like a list of the modifications made they are in the top comment of ``engine/source/defines.hpp``. I also took the platform layer design from [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) by [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman) and modified it for use with my game engine.
- Thank you to [Code Gains](https://www.youtube.com/@Code_Gains) for the idea and motivation to create my game engine. They created [DX11-Engine](https://github.com/Code-Gains/DX11-Engine). My game engine is in a very early state compared to Code Gain's engine.

## Versions of Tools
- [Premake5 V5.0.0-beta2](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta2)
- [Lua binaries V5.4.2](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/)

## To-Do
My game engine is less of a mess. I have removed some items from the checklist that have already been completed.
- [X] Create an application layer.
- [X] Open a window on Windows platform layer.
- [ ] Handle window events on Windows platform layer.
- [ ] Event handling system integrated with application layer.
- [ ] Windows platform layer. (W.I.P)
- [ ] Linux platform layer.
- [ ] Work on LUA integration using [Sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2).
